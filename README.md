# Quantum Harmonic Oscillator

This project provides a numerical and visual exploration of the quantum 
harmonic oscillator using Hermite polynomials. The project includes 
functions to generate Hermite polynomials, compute wavefunctions for 
different quantum states, calculate expectation values, and visualize 
probability densities.

## Documentation

For a comprehensive overview of this project, including detailed 
explanations, equations, and usage instructions, please refer to the main 
documentation:
[Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Documentation 
(PDF)](docs/Quantum_Harmonic_Oscillator_Documentation.pdf).

## Features
- **Hermite Polynomial Generation:** Uses numerical methods to generate 
Hermite polynomials for constructing the wavefunctions.
- **Wavefunction Calculation:** Computes and normalizes wavefunctions for 
various quantum states of the harmonic oscillator.
- **Expectation Values:** Calculates expectation values and uncertainties, 
providing insights into the particle's localization.
- **Visualization:** Plots wavefunctions and probability densities to 
illustrate quantum states.
